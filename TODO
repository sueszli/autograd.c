todo:

- build (copy pytorch)
    - https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/README.html
    - CMake Version (CMakeLists.txt) - 3.16
    - vcpkg?
    - clang?

- qa
    - unit test library

- golang style concurrency
    - defer
    - goroutines

- idiomatic types:
    - int, float, double, char, byte, bool - with clear size specification like int32, int64, float32, float64
    - string
    - array, list, map, set, tuple, struct, class, enum, union, variant, optional
    - parallel for loops
    - lambda expressions

then implement a neural network library from scratch training mnist or something simple
just for the funsies

---

later also make one in c++, then try out accelerators (cuda, openmp, apple metal)
