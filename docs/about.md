a small educational autograd engine written in c that provides reference counted tensors with autograd metadata, reverse mode differentiation for scalar losses, arena allocated function nodes with explicit dependency counting, deterministic backward execution independent of queue order, centralized gradient accumulation with broadcast reduction, co located forward and backward implementations for each op, a minimal but complete api for tensor lifecycle and basic math ops, and a tightly enforced invariant driven design optimized for simplicity, locality, and debuggability.
