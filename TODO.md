- start from scratch, minimize loc

improvements:

- implement tensor op basics, computational graph, loss function, etc.
- improve accuracy, improve performance
- blas, openmp, mlir, apple metal gpu, pytorch, xsimd, xtensor

finally:

- store weights in a compressed format
- implement a python binding just for predictions
